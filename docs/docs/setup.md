Add all dependencies to your project with yarn:

```
yarn add -D ng-vacuum shallow-render omnimock
```

Or with npm:
```
npm install --save-dev ng-vacuum shallow-render omnimock
```

NgVacuum uses [OmniMock](https://github.com/hmil/omnimock) and [shallow-render](https://github.com/getsaf/shallow-render) to mock service and component dependencies. You must install all three packages separately.
